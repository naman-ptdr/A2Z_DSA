// Morris Preorder Traversal of a Binary Tree

// Problem Statement: Given a Binary Tree, implement Morris Preorder Traversal and return the array containing its preorder sequence.

// Morris Preorder Traversal is a tree traversal algorithm aiming to achieve a space complexity of O(1) without recursion or an external data structure. The algorithm should efficiently visit each node in the binary tree in preorder sequence, printing or processing the node values as it traverses, without using a stack or recursion.
// Algorithm / Intuition
// A prerequisite to this problem is Morris Inorder Traversal of Binary Tree. We extend Morris Inorder Traversal to Preorder Morris Traversal and modify the algorithm to print the current nodeâ€™s value before moving to the left child when the right child of the inorder predecessor is null.

// This change ensures that the nodes are processed in the desired order for Preorder Traversal. The basic structure of Morris Traversal remains intact, but the printing step is adjusted, resulting in a Preorder Traversal that is still in-place and has a constant space complexity.


// In Morris Inorder Traversal, we are traversing the tree in the way: Left, Root, Right. In Morris Preorder traversal we want to traverse the tree in the way: Root, Left, Right. Therefore, the following code changes are required:

// When the current node has a left child:

// In Morris Inorder Traversal, a new thread is created by establishing a temporary link between the current node and its in-order predecessor. In Morris Preorder Traversal, we want to print the root before visiting the left child. Therefore, after setting the thread (establishing the link), we print the current node's value before moving it to its left child.


// When the current node has no left child:

// This case remains unchanged from Morris Inorder Traversal. If the current node has no left child, there is nothing to visit on the left side. In both Inorder and Preorder traversals, we want to print the current node's value and move to the right child. Therefore, there is no code modification needed for this scenario.


// Algorithm:
// Step 1:Initialise a current to traverse the tree. Set current to the root of the Binary Tree.

// Step 2: While the current is not null: If the current node has no left child, print the current node's value and move to the right child ie. set current to its right child.


// Step 3: If the current node has a left child, we find the in-order predecessor of the current node. This in-order predecessor is the rightmost node in the left subtree or the left subtree's rightmost node.

// If the right child of the in-order predecessor is null:

// Set the right child to the current node.
// Print the value of the current node as preorder traverses the tree in the inorder: Root, Left then Right.
// Move to the left child (i.e., set current to its left child).
// If the right child of the in-order predecessor is not null:

// Revert the changes made in the previous step by setting the right child as null.
// Move to the right child (i.e., set current to its right child).
// Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the end of the tree is reached.

// Time Complexity: O(2N) where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree.

// The time complexity is linear, as each node is visited at most twice (once for establishing the temporary link and once for reverting it).
// In each step, we perform constant-time operations, such as moving to the left or right child and updating pointers.
// Space Complexity: O(1) The space complexity is constant, as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.

// Morris Traversal does not use any additional data structures like stacks or recursion, making it an in-place algorithm.
// The only space utilised is for a few auxiliary variables, such as pointers to current and in-order predecessor nodes.
