// Allocate Minimum Number of Pages

// Problem Statement: Given an array ‘arr of integer numbers, ‘ar[i]’ represents the number of pages in the ‘i-th’ book. There are a ‘m’ number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.
// Allocate books in such a way that:

// Each student gets at least one book.
// Each book should be allocated to only one student.
// Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.
// You have to allocate the book to ‘m’ students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. If the allocation of books is not possible. return -1
