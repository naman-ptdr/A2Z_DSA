// Peak element in Array

// Problem Statement: Given an array of length N. Peak element is defined as the element greater than both of its neighbors. Formally, if 'arr[i]' is the peak element, 'arr[i - 1]' < 'arr[i]' and 'arr[i + 1]' < 'arr[i]'. Find the index(0-based) of a peak element in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.

// Note: For the first element, the previous element should be considered as negative infinity as well as for the last element, the next element should be considered as negative infinity.

// Pre-requisite: Binary Search Algorithm






#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int findPeakElement(vector<int> &arr) {
    int n = arr.size(); //Size of array.

    // Edge cases:
    if (n == 1) return 0;
    if (arr[0] > arr[1]) return 0;
    if (arr[n - 1] > arr[n - 2]) return n - 1;

    int low = 1, high = n - 2;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        //If arr[mid] is the peak:
        if (arr[mid - 1] < arr[mid] && arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1])
            return mid;

        // If we are in the left:
        if (arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1]) low = mid + 1;

        // If we are in the right:
        // Or, arr[mid] is a common point:
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    // Dummy return statement
    return -1;
