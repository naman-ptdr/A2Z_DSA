// Reverse Linked List in groups of Size K

// Problem Statement: Given the head of a singly linked list of `n` nodes and an integer `k`, where k is less than or equal to `n`. Your task is to reverse the order of each group of `k` consecutive nodes, if `n` is not divisible by `k`, then the last group of remaining nodes should remain unchanged.

// Approach: 
// The approach simplifies reversing linked list nodes by breaking the list into segments of K nodes and reversing each segment individually. Starting from the head, the algorithm traverses the list to identify segments of K nodes. Upon finding a segment, it reverses it, returning the modified list. If a segment has less than K nodes left (ie. remaining nodes at the end), they are left unaltered. 

// To implement this (complex) algorithm we can break down the process into three parts:

// `reverseLinkedList`: This function takes the head of a segment as input and reverses the linked list formed by that segment. It operates by utilizing the classic iterative 3-pointer method to reverse the direction of pointers within the segment. Read about this algorithm in detail here Reverse Linked List.

// `getKthNode`: The purpose of this function is to identify the end of a segment of K nodes in the linked list. Given a starting node, it traverses K nodes in the list and returns the Kth node, allowing the segmentation of the list into smaller parts for reversal.

// `kReverse`: The main function orchestrates the reversal process. It iterates through the linked list and identifies segments of K nodes using getKthNode. For each identified segment, it utilizes reverseLinkedList to reverse the nodes within that segment. This iterative approach efficiently reverses the linked list nodes in groups of K.

// Algorithm:
// Step 1: Initialise a pointer `temp` to the head of the linked list. Using `temp`, traverse to the Kth Node iteratively.

// Step 2: On reaching the Kth Node, preserve the Kth Node’s next node as `nextNode` and set the Kth Node’s next pointer to `null`. This effectively breaks the linked list in a smaller list of size K that can be reversed and attached back.


// Step 3: Treat this segment from `temp` to Kth Node as an individual linked list and reverse it. This can be done via the help of a helper function `reverseLinkedList` which has been discussed in detail in this article Reverse Linked List.

// Step 4: The reversed linked list segment returns a modified list with `temp` now at its tail  and the `KthNode` pointing to its head. Update the `temp`s `next` pointer to `nextNode`.

// If we are at the first segment of K nodes, update the head to `Kth Node`.


// Step 5: Continue this reversal for further groups. If a segment has fewer than K Nodes, leave them unmodified and return the new head. Use the prevLast pointer to maintain the link between the end of the previous reversed segment and the current segment.
