/*Delete Last Node of a Doubly Linked List

Problem Statement: Given a Doubly Linked List. Delete the last of a Doubly Linked List.

Examples
Disclaimer: Donâ€™t jump directly to the solution, try it out yourself first.

Solution:
Approach:

To delete the tail of a doubly linked list, we update the linkage between its last
node and its second last node. Since a doubly linked list is bidirectional, we set
the second last node's next pointer and the last node's back pointer to null. Then,

we return the head as the result.

Two edge cases to consider are:

If the input doubly linked list is empty, we return null.
If there is only one node in the list, that node itself will be the tail and we return
null after deleting that node.
Algorithm

Step 1: Traverse the doubly linked list to the last node and keep track of it using the
tail pointer.

We start from the head of the doubly linked list and iterate through the list using a while
loop until we reach the last node. The tail pointer is used to keep track of this last node.

Step 2: Obtain the second last node using the tail's back pointer, and name it the prev pointer.

Step 3: Set the 'next' pointer of the prev node to null. This step effectively disconnects
the initial tail node from the list in the forward direction, making prev the new tail node.

Step 4: Set the 'back' pointer of the tail node to null. This ensures that the tail node no
longer points back to the prev node, as it is now the last node in the list.

Step 5: Return the head of the doubly linked list as the result. Now that we have updated the
doubly linked list, the list is now one node shorter than before.

Time Complexity: O(1) Removing the head of a doubly linked list is a quick operation,
taking constant time because it only involves updating references.

Space Complexity: O(1) Deleting the head also has minimal memory usage, using a few
extra pointers without regard to the list's size.*/
