// Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

// Approach:  We maintain a variable count that keeps a track of the number of consecutive 1’s while traversing the array. The other variable max_count maintains the maximum number of 1’s, in other words, it maintains the answer.

// We start traversing from the beginning of the array. Since we can encounter either a 1 or 0 there can be two situations:-

// If  the value at the current index is equal to 1 we increase the value of count by one. After updating  the count variable if it becomes more than the max_count  update the max_count.
// If the value at the current index is equal to zero we make the variable count as 0 since there are no more consecutive ones.
//  See the illustration below for a better understanding
