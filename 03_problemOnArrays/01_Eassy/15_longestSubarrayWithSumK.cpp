// Longest Subarray with sum K | [Postives and Negatives]

// Problem Statement: Given an array and a sum k, we need to print the length of the longest subarray that sums to k.

// Algorithm / Intuition
// Optimal Approach (Using Hashing): 
// Approach:
// The steps are as follows:

// First, we will declare a map to store the prefix sums and the indices.
// Then we will run a loop(say i) from index 0 to n-1(n = size of the array).
// For each index i, we will do the following:
// We will add the current element i.e. a[i] to the prefix sum.
// If the sum is equal to k, we should consider the length of the current subarray i.e. i+1. We will compare this length with the existing length and consider the maximum one.
// We will calculate the prefix sum i.e. x-k, of the remaining subarray.
// If that sum of the remaining part i.e. x-k exists in the map, we will calculate the length i.e. i-preSumMap[x-k], and consider the maximum one comparing it with the existing length we have achieved until now.
// If the sum, we got after step 3.1, does not exist in the map we will add that with the current index into the map. We are checking the map before insertion because we want the index to be as minimum as possible and so we will consider the earliest index where the sum x-k has occurred. [Detailed discussion in the edge case section]
// In this approach, we are using the concept of the prefix sum to solve this problem. Here, the prefix sum of a subarray ending at index i, simply means the sum of all the elements of that subarray.

// Observation: Assume, the prefix sum of a subarray ending at index i is x. In that subarray, we will search for another subarray ending at index i, whose sum equals k. Here, we need to observe that if there exists another subarray ending at index i with sum k, then the prefix sum of the rest of the subarray will be x-k. The below image will clarify the concept:

// Now, for a subarray ending at index i with the prefix sum x, if we remove the part with the prefix sum x-k, we will be left with the part whose sum is equal to k. And that is what we want.

// That is why, instead of searching the subarrays with sum k, we will keep track of the prefix sum of the subarrays generated at every index using a map data structure. 

// In the map, we will store every prefix sum calculated, with the index(where the subarray with that prefix sum ends) in a <key, value> pair. Now, at index i, we just need to check the map data structure to get the index i.e. preSumMap[x-k] where the subarray with the prefix sum x-k ends. Then we will simply subtract that index i.e. preSumMap[x-k] from the current index i to get the length of the subarray with sum k i.e. len = i -preSumMap[x-k].

// We will apply the above process for all possible indices of the given array. The possible values of the index i can be from 0 to n-1(where n = size of the array).

// Edge Case: Why do we need to check the map if the prefix sum already exists?

// In the algorithm, we have seen that at step 3.4, we are checking the map if the prefix sum already exists, and if it does we are not updating it. Letâ€™s understand the reason by considering the following example:
// Assume the given array is {2, 0, 0, 3}. If we apply the algorithm to the given array without checking





#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int getLongestSubarray(vector<int>& a, int k) {
    int n = a.size(); // size of the array.

    map<int, int> preSumMap;
    int sum = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //calculate the prefix sum till index i:
        sum += a[i];

        // if the sum = k, update the maxLen:
        if (sum == k) {
            maxLen = max(maxLen, i + 1);
        }

        // calculate the sum of remaining part i.e. x-k:
        int rem = sum - k;

        //Calculate the length and update maxLen:
        if (preSumMap.find(rem) != preSumMap.end()) {
            int len = i - preSumMap[rem];
            maxLen = max(maxLen, len);
        }

        //Finally, update the map checking the conditions:
        if (preSumMap.find(sum) == preSumMap.end()) {
            preSumMap[sum] = i;
        }
    }

    return maxLen;
}

{
    vector<int> a = { -1, 1, 1};
